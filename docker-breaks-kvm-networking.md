Detailed on the ArchWiki below is a solution to an issue I was having when I tried to use a network bridge `br0` _alongside_ Docker on my server.

The solution that I thought worked initially was to add the below to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. This got the bridge working for virtual machines, but broke Docker container external connectivity (containers couldn't access the internet).

```json
{
  "bridge": "br0"
}
```

In the end I needed to run the `iptables` rule _instead_, and that got things working for both Docker and the Virtual Machines.

```sh
iptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -j ACCEPT
```
