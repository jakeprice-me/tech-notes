Delete all files that match a specific pattern. This is just `find` with `-delete` appended, so be careful!

Get your pattern working and returning the results you want before you use `-delete`.

```sh
# Files & directories:
$ find <path-to-search> -name '<pattern>' #-delete

# Files only:
$ find <path-to-search> -type f -name '<pattern>' #-delete

# Directories only:
$ find <path-to-search> -type d -name '<pattern>' #-delete
```
