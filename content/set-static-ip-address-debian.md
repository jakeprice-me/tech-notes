{{<admonition important>}}
There's a not insignificant chance you'll get kicked out of the server, so you should be physically present to reboot it to get back in. Don't do it on a server you can't access.

```sh
# File: /etc/network/interfaces
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug eno1
#iface eno1 inet dhcp
```

```sh
# File: /etc/network/interfaces.d/eno1

iface eno1 inet static
        address 10.0.0.226
        netmask 255.255.255.255
        gateway 10.0.0.1
```
