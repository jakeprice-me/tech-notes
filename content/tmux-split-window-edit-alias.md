This is a super handy shell alias I found on Reddit.

I've employed `edit` instead of `e`. With Vim, once you've opened the Vim split you can use the `fzf` plugin to search for a file and open it in that window. That means if you don't want to enter the path you can quickly open the split, and _then_ find the file with `fzf`.
