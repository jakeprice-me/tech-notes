title: Ctrl-A and DuckDuckGo Fedora Bug
type: tech-note
---

When trying to "select all" using `Ctrl` + `A` on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com), the whole page is selected instead of the contents of the search input field.

It's caused by having `Pointer Location` turned on in GNOME:

> It seems `/usr/libexec/gsd-locate-pointer`, when invoked under fvwm without session
> manager, will enable "show pointer location when pressing Ctrl key"
> even when the underlying value of the dconf/gsettings key is false.
> This interferes duckduckgo's search box, making key shortcuts with Ctrl
> prefix (e.g. Ctrl+C for copy) unusable. The issue is gone after we stop invoking this gsd plugin.
