title: Windows Shortcuts for Visual Studio Code on MacOS
type: tech-note
---

I don't use Visual Studio Code much, but when I do at work, the shortcuts are completely different on my work MacBook in comparison to Linux (and Windows) which have the same shortcuts. It's completely unusable in that state for me, and I simply don't want to learn new shortcuts just for MacOS.

The [Windows Default Keybindings](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smcpeak.default-keys-windows) extension solves this perfectly.
