title: Stop & Start Docker Compose if You've Edited Your Compose File

I can never remember this, so for my future self, if you change your `compose.yaml` file, and then only `docker compose restart`, those changes *will not be picked up*. You *must* `docker compose stop && docker compose up -d` instead.

> If you make changes to your `compose.yml` configuration, *these changes are not reflected after running this command*. For example, changes to environment variables (which are added after a container is built, but before the container's command is executed) are not updated after restarting.
