`/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf` should have the below by default on Fedora at least, but on MacOS it doesn't and has to be added.

```ini
[ v3_ca ]
basicConstraints = critical,CA:TRUE
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
```

Also, append:

```ini
x509_extensions = v3_ca
```

To the end of `[ req ]`.
