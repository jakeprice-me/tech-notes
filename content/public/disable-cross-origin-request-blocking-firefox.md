When testing something that uses JavaScript locally, you may come across an error like this:

```text
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at file://///wsl$/fedoraremix/home/jprice/my/documents/code/cloud-operations/aws-environment-details-webapp/js/data/aws-environments.json?_=1601052634622. (Reason: CORS request not http).
```

It's only an issue when running locally, but a quick and easy way to resolve it can be found in `about:config` on Firefox. The following preference should be set to `false`.

{{< admonition warning >}}
Make sure you set it back to `true` once you have finished testing.
{{< /admonition >}}

```ini
security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy: false
```
