Use the scope inspector to debug grammars. You can view scopes for a selected token.

Enable it with `Ctrl-Shift-P` and type in `scope` and select `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes`

You can also create a keybinding for it.

``` bash
{
  "key": "cmd+alt+shift+i",
  "command": "editor.action.inspectTMScopes"
}
```
