title: Switch Shortcut Modes on Logitech MX Keys
type: tech-note
---

I was experiencing what I thought was a strange bug on my Logitech MX Keys, that whenever I used the keyboard, via my dock (which meant it was using the Logitech Unified Receiver) then the `Alt` key was the `Windows` key, and vice versa. Really jarring.

I found out that it's simple to fix. You just have to switch to the Windows (or Linux) shortcuts.

> Press fn and the letter for 3 seconds.

> MacOS: fn + O
> Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: fn + P

This switches it between the shortcut modes.
