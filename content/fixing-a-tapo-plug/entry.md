title: Fixing a Tapo Plug
type: tech-note

I have a Tapo P110 Smart Plug that every now and then stops working. It responds to on/off commands, but doesn't actually switch the plug on or off, all you hear is a little clicking noise and that's all.

I can't remember where I found this out, but I'm pretty sure that, hilariously, a Tapo Support agent told me to try it. All you have to do is bang the plug against something a couple of times. Every time it's happened, it's fixed the issue.
