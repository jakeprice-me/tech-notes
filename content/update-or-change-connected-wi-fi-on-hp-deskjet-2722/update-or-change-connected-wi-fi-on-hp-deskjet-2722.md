> [!tip]
> If the HP Smart app isn't very smart, and can't find the printer. Restart the printer. It usually get's picked up after that.

To reset the currently stored Wi-Fi, and activate Wi-Fi Setup mode press the "Cancel" and "Wi-Fi" buttons at the same time until the Wi-Fi button light flashes blue (which can take up to 15 seconds or so).

Then download and use [HP Smart](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hp.printercontrol) on Android and follow through the settings for adding a new printer.
