title: Enable Vim +clipboard Support On Fedora
type: tech-note
---

> So, installing vim-enhanced and vim-X11 is enough, but is not at the same time. To enable the system functions like +clipboard, you moreover need to use the `vimx` executable rather than vim or vi (even though they are probably identical, the name changes the behaviour).
> 
> One way how to do that permanently is by adding aliases in your .bashrc file:
> 
> ```sh
> alias vi='vimx'
> alias vim='vimx'
> ```
> 
> The complete list of features that get enabled this way is: +balloon_eval, +browse, +clientserver, +clipboard, +dnd, +mouseshape, +toolbar, +X11, +xim, +xsmp_interact, +xterm_clipboard, +xpm.
> 
> However, some of them are probably irrelevant for the terminal version of vimx and only do something for GVim.
