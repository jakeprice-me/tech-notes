It's important to hide the version of Tomcat that is being used to ensure the baddies are unsure!

Create a new set of directories under the Tomcat `lib` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p /opt/apache/tomcat/lib/org/apache/catalina/util
```

Then create a new file under the newly created `util` directory called `ServerInfo.properties`, and copy the below into it:

```ini
server.info=
```

The `server.info` property takes a string, but it's better to have no information on version at all, so the above hides it completely.

Then restart Tomcat, and if you enter a bad request the version will not be included.
