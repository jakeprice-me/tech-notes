On the initial "Site Login" screen that opens when WinSCP is launched, fill in the below details:

```yaml
File protocol: Amazon S3
Host name: s3.amazonaws.com
Access key ID: <access-key>
Secret access key: <secret-access-key>
```

Then click on `Advanced`, navigate to `Environments > Directories` and fill in the remote directory (which is the S3 bucket name).

```yaml
Remote directory: /<bucket-name>
```
