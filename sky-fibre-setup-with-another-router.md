Setup is _really_ easy. No need to use the Sky Router at all. 

Under `Advanced Setup` on the R7800 [Administration Page](http://10.19.90.1/adv_index.htm) go to `Setup` > `Internet Setup`, and under `DHCP Option` you should see a field for `Client Identifier String (Option 61)`. Paste the following string into the text field:

```
anything@skydsl|anything
```

You can replace the `anything` but you actually don't need to. Once you click `Apply`, you should immediately pick up an IP Address in the `Internet IP Address` section, as long as `Get Dynamically from ISP` is selected.
