Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Then you can use it to clone a repository, and save the need for a private key. Especially helpful on a server.

```sh
# Clone a repository:
git clone https://<token>@github.com/owner/repo.git

# Clone a branch from a repository:
git clone --branch <branch-name> https://<token>@github.com/owner/repo.git
```
