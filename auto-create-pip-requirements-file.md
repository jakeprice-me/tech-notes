> You can use the following code to generate a requirements.txt file:
> 
>     pip install pipreqs
>     
>     pipreqs /path/to/project
>

> Sometimes you come across `pip freeze`, but this saves all packages in the environment including those that you don't use in your current project.

Simply run the below in a Python directory and it will create a `requirements.txt` populated with current dependencies.

```sh
pipreqs --force .
```

You can then install all those dependencies by pointing `pip` to the file.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
