If you need to resize an EC2 instance, or an additional mounted volume in AWS.

To unmount the drive, you may need to comment out the entry for it in `/etc/fstab` otherwise it'll be in use when it starts up. Do this, then restart, check it's not mounted and run `sudo e2fsck -f /dev/xvdh` then if all clean `sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdh` you can then check it's extended with `df -h`
