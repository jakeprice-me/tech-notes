I had an issue with a SONOFF SNZB-02 temperature & humidity sensor, after replacing the battery I couldn't get it to reconnect to Zigbee2MQTT without the power column showing a question mark for the battery status. As a result it wasn't exposing any results. 

There was nothing in the log file either.

What eventually did the trick I think was restarting Zigbee2MQTT from Settings > Restart Zigbee2MQTT in the Zigbee2MQTT dashboard on Home Assistant. It then paired and finally published the battery status - although it doesn't seem like the battery is reporting correctly - initially it showed around 20%, and after clicking the reconfigure button it now shows around 62%, but that's still lower than expected for a new battery - unless it's been pulling power more than usual because of whatever issue was going on?

If you're really having no luck with it, remove the battery for a few minutes and then follow the above.
