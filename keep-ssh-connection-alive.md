The option `-o ServerAliveInterval=60` tells the SSH agent to keep sending "pings" to keep the connection alive.

Example below.

```sh
ssh -v -o ServerAliveInterval=60 myname@myhost.com
```

Alternatively you can add it the your ssh config file for all hosts:

```sh
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
```
